# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with color theme switcher
 
## Welcome üçÉ

This project challenged by Frontend Mentor was an excellent project to put my SCSS, DOM skills, and API handles into practice. The project is about consuming a countries API, making some countries' filters, see more detailed information about the country clicked on a separate page, click through to the border countries on the detail page and toggle colour sheme
